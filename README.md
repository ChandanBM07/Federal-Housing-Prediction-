This project addresses the crucial challenge of accurately predicting housing prices in the real estate industry. Using a comprehensive dataset with 79 predictors including property size, location, garage capacity, and amenities, we implemented multiple machine learning algorithms ranging from basic linear regression to advanced ensemble methods like XGBoost and Random Forest.
The study demonstrates the critical role of feature engineering, model selection, and ensemble techniques in improving prediction accuracy. Our best-performing model (XGBoost) achieved an RMSE of 0.129, significantly outperforming baseline models and showcasing the potential of machine learning in real estate analytics.
